Chevereto is a self-hosted multipurpose multi-user, full-featured media sharing solution. It can be used to create a myriad of applications or to empower existing systems, all around the concept of users sharing media content.

In a nutshell, Chevereto is:

- ü§ó A [community](https://chevereto.com/community/) driven software
- ‚ú® Headless software - bring your own user interface
- üîå Pluggable - make it truly _yours_
- üå± Grow as you want with a variety of servicing strategies
- ü§ë Monetize it - go ahead and [Monetize your Chevereto installation](https://rodolfo.is/2021/01/20/monetize-your-chevereto-installation/)

## Technical Overview

This is the repository for the Chevereto V4 application project skeleton, which orchestrates the whole thing. In Chevereto, [API](https://github.com/Chevereto/api) provides all the I/O for user instructions which are driven by the application. The administration for the user application content is provided by [API Admin](https://github.com/Chevereto/api-admin).

On the [Peafowl](https://github.com/Chevereto/peafowl) and [Dashboard](https://github.com/Chevereto/dashboard) are the default web clients for API and API Admin. The concept of "default" is very important here because Chevereto is _built_ to be plugged to _any_ given interface, is not limited to just the defaults, and hopefully it will get _many_ cool user interfaces.

Chevereto also provides an OAuth2 server supporting third-party login providers, which handles account access, sessions and credentials. That way, Chevereto API-client users connect to the same login experience regardless of the user interface being used. In this context, the given user interface appears to the user as an application authorized to the account.
