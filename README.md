Chevereto is a multi-user, full-featured media sharing solution. It's your services. Your rules, your eyes. Say goodbye to closures, restrictions and data mining on your media.

Chevereto is a [mature project](#history) which has been always evolving. Also, we are proudly:

- 100% indie developed
- [Community](https://chevereto.com/community/) driven
- Open Source Licensed (OSI approved)
- Largely used at all levels, specially at [high scale](#-powered-by-chevereto)
- Highly extensible, configurable and pluggable

## Technical Overview

This is the repository for the Chevereto V4 application project skeleton, which orchestrates the whole thing. In Chevereto, [API](https://github.com/Chevereto/api) provides all the I/O for user instructions which are driven by the application. The administration for the user application content is provided by [API Admin](https://github.com/Chevereto/api-admin).

On the other hand, [Peafowl](https://github.com/Chevereto/peafowl) and [Dashboard](https://github.com/Chevereto/dashboard) are the default web clients for API and API Admin. The concept of "default" is very important here because Chevereto is _built_ to be plugged to _any_ given interface, is not limited to just the defaults, and hopefully it will get _many_ cool user interfaces.

Chevereto also provides an OAuth2 server supporting third-party login providers, which handles account access, sessions and credentials. That way, Chevereto API-client users connect to the same login experience regardless of the user interface being used. In this context, the given user interface appears to the user as an application authorized to the account.

## History

Chevereto project began in 2007 as a self-hosted alternative to ImageShack when they blocked the images on my forum and it started as a simple one-click web uploader. It got good reception, and it became an Open Source project. I started this on college and I made my career around it.

During all these years many things have happened, licensing has changed a couple of times and to keep it short on August 2016 a fork, named [Chevereto-Free](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto-free), was released to kickstart the process of turning all Chevereto into Open Source.

And here we are!

### Major Releases

| Version                                            | Date       | Licensing (release) | Licensing (actual) |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| [V1](https://code.google.com/archive/p/chevereto/) | 2009-02-26 | MIT License         | MIT License        |
| [V2](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto-2)     | 2011-06-15 | Proprietary         | MIT License        |
| [V3](https://chevereto.com/releases)               | 2014-04-05 | Proprietary         | Proprietary (*)    |
| [V4](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto)       | TBD        | MIT License         | MIT License        |

(*) V3 will eventually merge with Chevereto-Free into MIT license.

## Funding

The intention has been always to make the project profitable to sustain its ongoing development and I've managed to making my living out of it. I'm proud of being able to focus exclusively on Chevereto development and nothing else.

### Extra features (license addons)

By [purchasing](https://chevereto.com/pricing/) a V3 license you get access to extra features and an additional support response. Paid licensing is still available for V3, and it represent the main source of income for the project ongoing expenses.

> **Note:** Most V3 paid features will be delivered as stand-alone plugins for V4. There will be a special plugin price for those coming from paid V3.

Chevereto won't be possible thanks to the support of all those who have purchased a license already. ‚ù§ THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

### Custom development

Custom development is available, although it has a very tall price. However, if you want to build your application around Chevereto I'm your ultimate choice as I created on my own the entire framework and application architecture.

### Donations

Development of this software is a life project that has consumed many years of my time. **I don't work for any company**, I'm not backed by anyone else except users of this software.

‚ù§ I thank very much all my [donors](DONORS.md).

### Sponsoring development

Any [issue](https://github.com/Chevereto/chevereto/issues) or [RFC](https://github.com/Chevereto/rfc-sourcing/blob/master/RFC.md) can be [sponsored](SPONSORS.md) to be pushed for development.

### Servicing

Usually Open Source endeavors benefit from the services related to the software itself like support, servers, moderation APIs, management, customizations, etc. However, I do self-hosted software. Not SaaS, nor hosting, neither distribution of a large scale service. To offer those services it will require me to put my focus in stuff that even being related, turns out to be completely different when running a business.

With Chevereto V4 I want to be focused _exclusively_ in the software so I'm encouraging others to provide the services and products needed for a better Chevereto experience:

#### Tech support

I've the intention of allowing third-party tech support. That way, others can deliver quality support under either my supervision or certification. Are you interested? Feel free to [contact](#contact) me.

#### Cloud

I want to run a [cloud](https://chevereto.cloud/) version of Chevereto. Are you someone with plenty experience in delivering cloud applications? Feel free to [contact](#contact) me.
