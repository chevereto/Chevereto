# Donors

Donations are welcome and highly appreciated and help to sustain development. You can send your one-time donation via [PayPal](https://paypal.me/RodolfoBerrios). Common assets required in development are also welcome like hosting, servers, computers, etc.

Donors contribute to development by giving away money/things without any particular condition. This money is used mostly for my personal needs and I take donations as a well-earned pat in the back in return for my hard work. ðŸ¥³ With this money I will amuse myself, I promise that I will really enjoy the money to be always thankful of those who value and want to contribute to my work.
