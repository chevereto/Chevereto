# Sponsors

Sponsors contribute to development by putting money in return of features wanted to be added to the software. I like to think about this as _sponsored driven development_ because the features will be available for other users of the software.

> 👨🏾‍💻 **Note:** If you require an unique customization check the [addon development](#meh) documentation or consider [💰 hiring me](../chevereto/README.md#contact) for it.

## Sponsored development

[Contact me](../chevereto/README.md#contact) to discuss what you want me to add to the software. If you don't know exactly what to purpose, check the [RFC sourcing](https://github.com/Chevereto/rfc-sourcing/blob/master/RFC.md) for ideas that you could sponsor.

Features implemented under the umbrella of an sponsor could be implemented directly in the software or to distribute it as an addon. Multiple sponsors per feature are welcome (as crowd sourcing).
